# Project Name: CNN Waste Segregation

## General Information

### Project Information

- The project is a CNN project that uses the waste management Garbage data classification to predict an input image belongs to which garbage category.
- This project applies deep learning techniques to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable waste management practices. 

### Project Background

- Improper waste disposal contributes to environmental degradation, increased landfill waste and inefficient recycling processes.
- Manual sorting is labour-intensive, error-prone and costly.
- An AI-powered waste classification system addresses these challenges by streamlining waste segregation, reducing operational costs and improving recycling rates.

### Key Business Benefits

- Automated waste sorting, cutting time and labour.
- Increased recycling rated by precise classification of recyclables.

### Use Cases:

- Smart Recycling Bins
- Automated Waste Sorting Facilities
- Waste Monitoring and Reporting

### Data Set

- The data set is a garbage file with the different classes of Garbage as subfolders containing images belonging to that class.
- The dataset consists of images of some common waste material categories.
- The images are classified into seven categories, namely: Food Waste, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Other, Cardboard, and Glass. 
- The data set contains seven folders, one containing images of each waste category.
- Approximately 7,000 raw images are divided among the categories.
- The data set consists of multiple folders, each representing a specific class, such as Cardboard, Food_Waste and Metal.
- Each folder contains images of objects that belong to that category. However, these items are not further subcategorised.
- For instance, the Food_Waste folder may contain images of items such as coffee grounds, tea bags and fruit peels without explicitly stating that they are coffee grounds or tea bags.
